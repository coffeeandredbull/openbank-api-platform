# OpenBank API Platform

## Project Overview

OpenBank API Platform is an **educational enterprise API-management platform**
inspired by the concepts found in enterprise API-management products such as
WSO2 API Manager. It is **NOT a clone** of any product. It is an original,
from-scratch implementation built to demonstrate how such platforms work, so
that every architectural decision can be explained and defended in a technical
interview.

The platform demonstrates a broad set of enterprise concerns working together,
including API management, API gateways, authentication, authorization, JWT and
OAuth2 concepts, API subscriptions, API versioning, rate limiting, Redis,
PostgreSQL, microservices, Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and API analytics.

## Purpose

- Provide a working, understandable example of an end-to-end API management
  platform.
- Show how API providers expose, secure, version, meter, and analyze their APIs
  through a developer portal and an API gateway.
- Demonstrate authentication (JWT / OAuth2 concepts) and fine-grained
  authorization (RBAC, subscriptions, scopes).
- Illustrate microservice architecture with shared infrastructure
  (PostgreSQL, Redis) and the trade-offs that come with it.
- Serve as an interview-ready project where every design choice has an explicit
  rationale.

## High-Level Architecture

```
Developer Portal (frontend, React + TypeScript)
              |
              v
        API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
        - request routing, JWT validation,
          rate limiting, subscription enforcement
              |
              v
  ----------------------------- shared infra -----------------------------
  PostgreSQL (system of record)     Redis (caching, tokens, rate limits)
  ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------
              |
   Backend microservices (Spring Boot)
   1. Identity Service
   2. API Management Service
   3. Subscription Service
   4. Account Service
   5. Payment Service
   6. Transaction Service
   7. Analytics Service
```

All client traffic enters through the API Gateway. The Developer Portal is the
user-facing React application that developers use to discover APIs, subscribe
to them, and manage credentials.

> **Status note:** This is the *planned* architecture. As of Phase 1 this
> repository contains only project documentation — no application code exists
> yet. See the [architecture document](docs/architecture.md) for details and
> each file in [`docs/`](docs/) for requirements, database design, security
> model, and API design.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA |
| Data | PostgreSQL, Redis |
| Gateway | Spring Cloud Gateway |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript |
| Testing | JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes |
| API documentation | OpenAPI |

These choices are fixed per `AGENTS.md` and are not changed without asking.
Kafka, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, GraphQL, gRPC, service discovery, cloud
infrastructure, and AI features are explicitly out of scope unless requested.

## Current Development Status

- **Phase 1 — Project documentation (current):**
  - Repo initialized, `AGENTS.md` and documentation created.
  - No application code exists.
  - Nothing is implemented, deployed, or runnable.
- **Planned phases (subject to change):** each service, the API Gateway, the
  Developer Portal, shared infrastructure (PostgreSQL/Redis via Docker
  Compose), CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and Kubernetes manifests will be built in
  small, explicitly requested phases and verified (compile + tests) at each
  step.

## Planned Features

- **Identity Service:** user registration, login, issuance and validation of
  JWT access tokens, OAuth2-style flows, role and scope management.
- **API Management Service:** registry of published APIs, API versions,
  endpoint metadata, documentation, and lifecycle state (e.g. published,
  deprecated).
- **Subscription Service:** developer applications, credentials (API keys /
  client IDs / client secrets), API subscriptions with tiers.
- **Account Service:** customer bank accounts and balances.
- **Payment Service:** payment initiation and approval workflows.
- **Transaction Service:** transaction history for accounts.
- **Analytics Service:** aggregated request usage and performance metrics
  published from gateway/service activity.
- **API Gateway:** central entry point — routing, JWT validation, rate
  limiting, subscription enforcement, request observability.
- **Developer Portal:** React/TypeScript UI to browse APIs, register, create
  applications, subscribe, and view usage analytics.
- **Shared infrastructure:** PostgreSQL as system of record; Redis for caching,
  token storage, and rate-limit counters.
- **CI/CD & orchestration:** Docker images, Docker Compose for local
  development, GitHub Actions pipelines, Kubernetes manifests.

## Design Principles

- Original implementation, not a WSO2 clone. Concepts are borrowed and
  reimplemented from scratch; code and design remain explainable.
- Thin controllers, business logic in services, DB access in repositories,
  DTOs at API boundaries, centralized error handling, validation of all
  external input, appropriate HTTP status codes.
- No placeholder functionality: no fake authentication, no fake analytics, no
  hardcoded fake security. Anything not implemented is documented as planned.

## Documentation

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — services, gateway, portal, shared
  infrastructure, request flow.
- [Requirements](docs/requirements.md) — functional and non-functional
  requirements.
- [Database](docs/database.md) — planned entities, ownership, PostgreSQL
  strategy.
- [Security](docs/security.md) — authentication, JWT, RBAC, secrets, rate
  limiting, security boundaries.
- [API design](docs/api-design.md) — REST conventions, status codes, DTOs,
  errors, versioning.
